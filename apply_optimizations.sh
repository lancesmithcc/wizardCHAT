echo "üìä Optimization Summary:"
echo "- Reduced maximum symbols from 25 to 10"
echo "- Implemented symbol pooling for reuse"
echo "- Added request debouncing (1s minimum)"
echo "- Enhanced caching (50 entries, 15 min)"
echo "- Reduced token counts for reliability"
echo "- Optimized timeouts for Netlify limits"
echo "- Added connection status monitoring"
echo ""

echo "üéØ Next Steps:"
echo "1. Test locally with 'npm start' if available"
echo "2. Commit changes: git add . && git commit -m 'Apply performance optimizations'"
echo "3. Deploy to Netlify: git push origin main"
echo "4. Test levels 1-3 for best reliability"

echo "üí° Tips:"
echo "- Level 1-3 (Brief to Balanced) are most reliable"
echo "- Level 4-6 may still timeout on busy servers"
echo "- Cache persists for 15 minutes"
echo "- Check browser console for debug info"
